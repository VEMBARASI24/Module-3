# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

##  Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

##  Program
```
tuplex = input()
print("n" in tuplex)
print("8" in tuplex)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
